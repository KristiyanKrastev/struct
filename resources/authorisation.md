https://github.com/djvirgen/virgen-acl Simple and elegant, create your own checks. No middleware?

https://github.com/OptimalBits/node_acl Use as middleware, create your own roles and access. Great choice.

https://github.com/tschaub/authorized Similar to connect roles... but a bit more robust? you can create roles and action, and associate many roles with that action

https://github.com/scottkf/ability-js Like canCan for rails. This is a traditional controller / function type permission system. May be too abstract.

https://github.com/dresende/node-roles More traditional setRole() hasRole() based checking. Last activity 2 years ago.

https://github.com/carlos8f/node-relations Natural language style roles. Looks very promising and is in active development

https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/connect-roles Simple and closer to action / natural language based. Requires writing your own checks for each.

https://github.com/ajlopez/SimplePermissions Maybe too simple? Makes sense for assigning roles but then its hard to check against roles!

https://npmjs.org/package/entitlement Not ideal but here for reference sake.
